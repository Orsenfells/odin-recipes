    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Baked ziti is a popular casserole with ziti pasta and a Neapolitan-style tomato-based sauce characteristic of Italian-American cuisine. It is a form of pasta al forno. Typically, the pasta is first boiled separately until it is nearly, but not completely, done. The almost-cooked pasta is added to a tomato-based sauce</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ziti or penne pasta</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk italian sausage, ground beef, or ground pork</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 cups jarred marinara or pasta sauce, or make your own tomato sauce</li>
        <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 heaping cup ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Preheat the oven</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the pasta:</h3>
            <p>Heat a large pot of salted water (for every 2 quarts of water, one tablespoon of salt) to a strong boil. Add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente—edible but still a little firm to the bite.</p>
            <p>Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you make the sauce. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Brown the meat: </h3>
            <p>While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well. </p>
            <p>Don't stir that often or it will be more difficult for the meat to brown. If you are using ground beef or pork instead of sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the sauce: </h3>
            <p>When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. </p>
            <p> Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.

                Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper, if needed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Assemble the casserole: </h3>
            <p>Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole. </p>
            <p>Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese. </p>
            <p>At this point, you can cool, cover, and refrigerate or freeze to make ahead.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bake: </h3>
            <p>Bake uncovered in the oven at 350°F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
