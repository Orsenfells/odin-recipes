    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken and dumplings is a soup that consists of a chicken cooked in water, with the resulting chicken broth being used to cook the dumplings by boiling. A dumpling—in this context—is a biscuit dough, which is a mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid. The dumplings are dropped, or formed into a ball.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 chicken cut into pieces</li>
        <li> 1 onion</li>
        <li> 3 large carrots cut into thirds</li>
        <li> 3 stalks celery cut into thirds</li>
        <li> 8 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li> salt & pepper to taste</li>
